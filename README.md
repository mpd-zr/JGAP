# Java Genetic Algorithm and Genetic Programming framework (JGAP)
This project is a fork of JGAP (pronounced "jay-gap"), a Java framework for developing and experimiting with GAs and GP.
The original project can be found here: http://jgap.sourceforge.net/

## Why yet another fork
The project was forked to encorporate changes to the underlying mechanisms such as different versions of genetic selection and mixed GA/GP  approaches without loosing track of what was changed. As it was not possible to commit those changes to the original JGAP it was forked. This project also includes some fixes found in the original implementation.
